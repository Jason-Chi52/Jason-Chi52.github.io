            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm born in Rochester, lived in China for 10 years and came back, then moved to Louisiana for a bit and came back again.<br>
                My favorite thing about home is that I have everything I needed in my room.<br>
                I just like to hang out with friends when I'm free.<br>
                My impressions for RIT is pretty good besides the bathrooms on my dorm floor.<br> 
                I would like the superpower of teleportation, and super speed.

            <h2>My Hometown</h2>
            <p>
                I am born in Rochester, NY, but I also lived in China for 10 years when I was little. <br>
                So I guess Rochester and China are both my hometwon.<br>
                In China the food is really good, the cost of living is much cheaper.<br>
                I really like the fact that in China everything is much more convenient compare to some other places.<br>
                What is not good about China is that I cannot use google, I have to use the Chinese version of google.

            <h2> My Major and Classes: </h2>
            <p>
                My major is Computer Exploration. <br>
                I'm looking into the fields of computer science or software enginneering. <br>
                I was a game design and development major, and I did not think that was what I wanted.<br>
                So my counselor gave me the option to computing exploration.

            <h2> My Hobbies and Interests </h2>

            <p>My top interest right now is hanging out with my friends.</p>
            <p> These are some of my other interests:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Badminton</li>
                <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
                <li>Gym</li>
                <li>Video Gaming</li>
            </ul>

            <p> I used to just play video games when I was living in Louisinana because I did not have the chances to do anything else besides that.<br>
                After I got into RIT, I have found some other things that interests me.<br>
                I got back to being with my old friends and meet with some new people to get together and do something we are interested.
