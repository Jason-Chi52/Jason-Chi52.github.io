    <!-- HOMETOWN -->

      <h2>Hometown</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in Rochester, NY, but I also lived in China for 10 years
        when I was little. I consider both Rochester and China my hometowns.
        In China, the food is amazing and the cost of living is much
        cheaper. I really like how convenient everything is there—though
        not being able to use Google (having to rely on local search
        engines) can be frustrating.
